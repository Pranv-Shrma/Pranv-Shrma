##   Pranav Sharma - Machine Learning Engineer & Data Scientist

**I'm passionate about harnessing the power of machine learning and deep learning to solve real-world problems and empower businesses.** With a focus on chatbots, fine-tuning LLMs, and building practical tools, I'm constantly exploring new ways to leverage these technologies to drive growth and innovation.

**Current Focus:**

* **Chatbots:** Developing engaging and intelligent chatbots to enhance user experience and streamline customer interactions.
* **Fine-tuning LLMs:** Tailoring large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks and business needs.
* **Building Business-Oriented Tools:** Creating practical applications of machine learning and deep learning to assist businesses in achieving their goals.

**Languages & Tools:**

* Python ( Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
* SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* Git & Version Control Systems
* Cloud Platforms (AWS, Google Cloud Platform)
* Data Visualization Libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

**Always Learning & Exploring:**

* Continuously expanding my knowledge base in the ever-evolving realm of AI and machine learning.
* Eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to open-source projects.
